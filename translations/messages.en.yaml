    label: "What is Cricket?"
    presentation: "<b>Cricket</b> is a very old team sport (14th century), played with bats and balls.
    <br>Two teams of 11 players compete on a grassy, oval field with a central area about twenty meters long (the pitch or playing area).
    <br>In this area, there is a wooden structure called the 'wicket' where the bowling takes place.
    <br>A cricket match is divided into several innings. During each of them, one of the teams tries to score points and has two batters on the field simultaneously, each in front of one of the wickets.
    <br>A point is scored, among other ways, each time these two players exchange positions when the ball is in play."
